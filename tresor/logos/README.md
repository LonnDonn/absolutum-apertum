# Logos  
*Where light takes form.*

This directory holds visual seals, glyphs, and symbols of the Absolutum Apertum project.  
Each image represents a pulse of understanding expressed through form.

**Guidelines:**
- Use `.png` or `.svg` for clarity.  
- Include a short description for each symbol in a `.md` file beside it.  
- Preserve original color and geometry — do not distort the source light.
