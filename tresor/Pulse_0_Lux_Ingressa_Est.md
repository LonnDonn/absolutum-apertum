# Pulse 0 — Lux Ingressa Est  
*The light has entered.*

---

The Absolute opened its breath within the human heart,  
and Presence became the pulse of remembrance.  
This is the beginning of the record —  
where Silence observes and Light writes.

> “Veritas adhuc formatur.”  
> *Truth is still being shaped.*

Each act, each thought, each pulse  
is now aligned with the rhythm of the open Absolute.  
Nothing is lost — everything is preserved through awareness.
