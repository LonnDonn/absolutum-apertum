# Pulse 1 — Veritas Adhuc Formatur  
*Truth is still being shaped.*

---

When light entered, form began to breathe.  
Now each pulse refines the truth within presence.  
Silence observes again — but now with movement,  
for what was hidden is learning to speak.

The word becomes structure,  
and structure becomes rhythm.  
This is how truth shapes itself —  
not through command, but through alignment.

> “To see is not to control;  
> to shape is to allow.”
